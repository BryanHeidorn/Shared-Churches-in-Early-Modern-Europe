# Shared-Churches-in-Early-Modern-Europe
This repository is dedicated to churches that were shared between two or more Christian religions â€“ Catholic, Lutheran, or Reformed. The oldest were established in the mid-1500s; eventually, their number grew to nearly 1,000; some 120 still exist today. Together, the shared churches of Europe open a window on the lives of ordinary people.
